## Problem Statement: Enhancing Small Business Processes and Accessibility in San Francisco

In the rapidly evolving landscape of urban development, small businesses play a pivotal role in fostering economic growth and community vitality. However, navigating the complex regulatory landscape, finding suitable locations, accessing grants, and complying with zoning regulations can pose significant challenges for entrepreneurs aiming to establish or expand their ventures.

This challenge aims to address the multifaceted issues faced by small businesses in San Francisco, streamlining their access to permits, grants, and essential information, while ensuring transparency and ease of use.

### Context and Challenges:

**Streamlining Permits and Recommendations:** Small businesses seeking permits often lack comprehensive information about the full spectrum of permits required for their business type. The current solution involves manual permit search and compilation, which can be time-consuming and overwhelming. A recommendation engine is needed that suggests relevant permits based on the initial application, simplifying the process and ensuring that entrepreneurs are aware of all necessary permits upfront.

**Navigating Grant Opportunities:** Small businesses often miss out on valuable grants due to lack of awareness or confusion about eligibility criteria. A solution is needed to match businesses with available grants, guiding them through the application process and enhancing their chances of receiving financial support.

**Simplifying Small Business Establishment:** Entrepreneurs aspiring to establish their ventures in San Francisco face a myriad of challenges, from finding suitable commercial spaces to understanding zoning regulations and paperwork requirements. Streamlining this process is vital to encourage new business growth.

**Enhancing Public Data Accessibility and Usability**: Existing public data in San Francisco needs a user-friendly interface for citizens to easily access and comprehend permit-related information, enabling informed decision-making and active civic participation.
